The Titanic was the largest ship of its time, measuring 882.5 feet in length and weighing 53 thousand tons, powered by steam engines reaching speeds up to 25 miles per hour. Construction began on March 31, 1909, in Belfast, Northern Ireland, shortly after the completion of its sister ship, the Olympic. The ship was built by the company Harland and Wolff, competing with other nations to construct the biggest and fastest vessels. Onboard, first-class passengers enjoyed luxurious amenities like private baths, a gym, steam rooms, and even a swimming pool - remarkable features for that era. However, tragedy struck during its maiden voyage across the North Atlantic, where dangerous icebergs, some weighing up to 3 million tons, posed a serious threat. The sinking of the Titanic on April 15, 1912, resulted in the loss of around 1500 lives, with only about 700 survivors rescued by lifeboats. Communication errors, including delayed wireless iceberg warnings, worsened the disaster. The ship's design, meant to withstand head-on collisions but vulnerable to side impacts, played a role in its tragic fate, emphasizing important lessons in maritime safety and influencing future shipbuilding regulations.
