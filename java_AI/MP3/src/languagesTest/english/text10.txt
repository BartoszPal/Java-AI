Wind power harnesses the kinetic energy of wind through wind turbines to produce electricity. Wind farms located in windy regions onshore and offshore contribute significantly to electricity generation, providing a reliable and environmentally friendly energy source.
Hydroelectric power utilizes the gravitational force of flowing water to generate electricity. Large dams and hydroelectric plants capture the energy of rivers and streams, producing clean electricity with minimal greenhouse gas emissions. Pumped hydro storage systems also play a crucial role in stabilizing grid operations and integrating intermittent renewable energy sources.
Other emerging renewable energy technologies include tidal power, geothermal energy, and biomass energy, each offering unique opportunities for sustainable energy production.
