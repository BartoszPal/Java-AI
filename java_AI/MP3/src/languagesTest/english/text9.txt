Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power have emerged as vital components of global efforts to combat climate change and transition towards sustainable energy systems. Unlike fossil fuels, which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation, renewable energy offers cleaner alternatives that harness natural resources without depleting them.
Solar energy, derived from sunlight through photovoltaic cells or solar thermal systems, is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources worldwide. Solar panels installed on rooftops and in large-scale solar farms generate electricity efficiently and emit no greenhouse gases during operation.
